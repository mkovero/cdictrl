CDI engine controller

This is a joint project for 7226ctrl, using same electronics and principles developed there.
Idea is to be able run CDI engine on its own, without any other electrical control.

Everything is under heavy development, nothing is ready and working yet.
Example engine used to test this is 400CDI (M628) in biturbo configuration.
